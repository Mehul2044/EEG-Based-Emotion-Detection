## Emotion classification using DEAP Dataset
This project is about classifying human emotions using the DEAP dataset. The DEAP dataset is a multimodal dataset for the analysis of human affective states. It includes data from 32 participants, each participating in 40 two-minute trials. The data includes physiological signals, audiovisual data, and self-reports. The dataset is labeled with the valence and arousal values of the participants.

## Dataset
The DEAP dataset is available at [DEAP Dataset](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/index.html). The dataset includes the following data:
- **Physiological Signals**: The dataset includes EEG, GSR, ECG, and EMG signals.
- **Audiovisual Data**: The dataset includes audio and video recordings of the participants.
- **Self-Reports**: The dataset includes self-reports of the participants.
- **Labels**: The dataset includes the valence and arousal values of the participants.
- **Preprocessed Data**: The dataset includes preprocessed data for the analysis.
- **Features**: The dataset includes features extracted from the data.
- **Trials**: The dataset includes 40 two-minute trials for each participant.
- **Participants**: The dataset includes data from 32 participants.
- **Emotions**: The dataset includes data for the analysis of human affective states.

## Emotion Classification
The goal of this project is to classify human emotions using the DEAP dataset. The dataset includes physiological signals, audiovisual data, and self-reports. The data is labeled with the valence and arousal values of the participants. The valence and arousal values are used to classify the emotions of the participants. The classification is done using machine learning algorithms such as SVM, KNN, and Random Forest.
